We find that no finite-state Markov process that produces symbols with transition from state to state can serve as an English grammar. Furthermore, the particular subclass of such processes that producen-order statistical approximations to English do not come closer, with increasingn, to matching the output of an English grammar. We formalize-the notions of "phrase structure" and show that this gives us a method for describing language which is essentially more powerful, though still representable as a rather elementary type of finite-state process. Nevertheless, it is successful only when limited to a small subset of simple sentences. We study the formal properties of a set of grammatical transformations that carry sentences with phrase structure into new sentences with derived phrase structure, showing that transformational grammars are processes of the same elementary type as phrase-structure grammars; that the grammar of English is materially simplified if phrase structure description is limited to a kernel of simple sentences from which all other sentences are constructed by repeated transformations; and that this view of linguistic structure gives a certain insight into the use and understanding of language.},

  abstract = {We provide conceptual and mathematical foundations for near-term quantum natural language processing (QNLP), and do so in quantum computer scientist friendly terms. We opted for an expository presentation style, and provide references for supporting empirical evidence and formal statements concerning mathematical generality. We recall how the quantum model for natural language that we employ canonically combines linguistic meanings with rich linguistic structure, most notably grammar. In particular, the fact that it takes a quantum-like model to combine meaning and structure, establishes QNLP as quantum-native, on par with simulation of quantum systems. Moreover, the now leading Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) paradigm for encoding classical data on quantum hardware, variational quantum circuits, makes NISQ exceptionally QNLP-friendly: linguistic structure can be encoded as a free lunch, in contrast to the apparently exponentially expensive classical encoding of grammar. Quantum speed-up for QNLP tasks has already been established in previous work with Will Zeng. Here we provide a broader range of tasks which all enjoy the same advantage. Diagrammatic reasoning is at the heart of QNLP. Firstly, the quantum model interprets language as quantum processes via the diagrammatic formalism of categorical quantum mechanics. Secondly, these diagrams are via ZX-calculus translated into quantum circuits. Parameterisations of meanings then become the circuit variables to be learned. Our encoding of linguistic structure within quantum circuits also embodies a novel approach for establishing word-meanings that goes beyond the current standards in mainstream AI, by placing linguistic structure at the heart of Wittgenstein's meaning-is-context.},

The picture sources are the largely schematic pictures that occur in the same class of documents. However, the discussion is broadened slightly to include other picture sources. For a tiny fragment of English, the paper shows how the syntactic structure of text may be described, and then goes on to suggest that a similar analysis may be performed on the class of pictures under study. The description of these two kinds of information sources with a single class of descriptive techniques is suggested as an alternative to the synthetic approach in which artificial languages are specified and then learned and used. The major reason for doing syntactical analysis of such sources discussed here is that several information processing operations, amounting to the interpretation of the information sources looked upon as languages, can be done by the technique of syntax direction which uses the results of syntactic analysis to mediate subsequent processes for manipulating the information tokens. The paper concludes with an illustration of an algorithm for matching the sentences given by a simple grammar against the class of simple pictures which these sentences purport to describe.},

For natural spoken and written languages, grammars have been used for explaining their structure but for the two-dimensional generalization to designs, pictures, images, and fine arts, which has been known since 1964, almost no use has been made of grammars.The purpose of this paper is to call attention to the powerful dormant tools that can be used in the design arts. Some of the benefits of using these tools for describing existing (natural) design languages are discussed. How such uses may direct us from the more formal design arts into the fine arts is discussed by reporting progress on building a grammar for a class of contemporary paintings.},

The tests are accomplished by using the computer to generate new compositions in the style described. The authors demonstrate these methods with algorithmic descriptions of the styles of Richard Diebenkorn and Joan Mir\'o and the generation of new compositions in their styles. A shape grammar algorithm for Diebenkorn is presented which accounts for the linear facture of his "Ocean Park" series. The problem of shape in Mir\'o's work is tackled, and progress is reported on synthesizing composition in the style of his "Constellation" series. Further uses of algorithmic description of painting styles include mechanical storage, search and retrieval in art archives, attribution studies and diachronic studies of stylistic change.}

Building on the formal quantum-like nature of such interactions, we present a method for mapping DisCoCat diagrams to quantum circuits.

At the same time, in the area of quantum computing (QC), with the steady growth of quantum hardware and notable improvements towards implementations of quantum algorithms, we are approaching an era when quantum computers perform tasks that cannot be done on classical computers with a reasonable amount of resources. This provides an new range of opportunities for AI, and for NLP specifically. In this work, we work with the Categorical Distributional Compositional (DisCoCat) model of natural language meaning, whose underlying mathematical underpinnings make it amenable to quantum instantiations. Earlier work on fault-tolerant quantum algorithms has already demonstrated potential quantum advantage for NLP, notably employing DisCoCat. In this work, we focus on the capabilities of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware and perform the first implementation of an NLP task on a NISQ processor, using the DisCoCat framework. Sentences are instantiated as parameterised quantum circuits; word-meanings are embedded in quantum states using parameterised quantum-circuits and the sentence's grammatical structure faithfully manifests as a pattern of entangling operations which compose the word-circuits into a sentence-circuit. The circuits' parameters are trained using a classical optimiser in a supervised NLP task of binary classification. Our novel QNLP model shows concrete promise for scalability as the quality of the quantum hardware improves in the near future and solidifies a novel branch of experimental research at the intersection of QC and AI.},

We are interested in further advancing this field, focusing on composition. In contrast to current black-box AI methods, we are championing an interpretable compositional outlook on generative music systems. In particular, we are importing methods from the Distributional Compositional Categorical (DisCoCat) modelling framework for Natural Language Processing (NLP), motivated by musical grammars. Quantum computing is a nascent technology, which is very likely to impact the music industry in time to come. Thus, we are pioneering a Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) approach to develop a new generation of intelligent musical systems. This work follows from previous experimental implementations of DisCoCat linguistic models on quantum hardware. In this chapter, we present Quanthoven, the first proof-of-concept ever built, which (a) demonstrates that it is possible to program a quantum computer to learn to classify music that conveys different meanings and (b) illustrates how such a capability might be leveraged to develop a system to compose meaningful pieces of music. After a discussion about our current understanding of music as a communication medium and its relationship to natural language, the chapter focuses on the techniques developed to (a) encode musical compositions as quantum circuits, and (b) design a quantum classifier. The chapter ends with demonstrations of compositions created with the system.},

  abstract = {This thesis introduces quantum natural language processing (QNLP) models based on a simple yet powerful analogy between computational linguistics and quantum mechanics: grammar as entanglement. The grammatical structure of text and sentences connects the meaning of words in the same way that entanglement structure connects the states of quantum systems. Category theory allows to make this language-to-qubit analogy formal: it is a monoidal functor from grammar to vector spaces. We turn this abstract analogy into a concrete algorithm that translates the grammatical structure onto the architecture of parameterised quantum circuits. We then use a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm to train the model so that evaluating the circuits computes the meaning of sentences in data-driven tasks.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}The implementation of QNLP models motivated the development of DisCoPy (Distributional Compositional Python), the toolkit for applied category theory of which the first chapter gives a comprehensive overview. String diagrams are the core data structure of DisCoPy, they allow to reason about computation at a high level of abstraction. We show how they can encode both grammatical structures and quantum circuits, but also logical formulae, neural networks or arbitrary Python code. Monoidal functors allow to translate these abstract diagrams into concrete computation, interfacing with optimised task-specific libraries.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}The second chapter uses DisCopy to implement QNLP models as parameterised functors from grammar to quantum circuits. It gives a first proof-of-concept for the more general concept of functorial learning: generalising machine learning from functions to functors by learning from diagram-like data. In order to learn optimal functor parameters via gradient descent, we introduce the notion of diagrammatic differentiation: a graphical calculus for computing the gradients of parameterised diagrams.},

  abstract = {We present a representation for linguistic structure that we call a Fock-space representation, which allows us to embed problems in language processing into small quantum devices. We further develop a formalism for understanding both classical as well as quantum linguistic problems and phrase them both as a Harmony optimization problem that can be solved on a quantum computer which we show is related to classifying vectors using quantum Boltzmann machines. We further provide a new training method for learning quantum Harmony operators that describe a language. This also provides a new algorithm for training quantum Boltzmann machines that requires no approximations and works in the presence of hidden units. We additionally show that quantum language processing is BQP-complete, meaning that it is polynomially equivalent to the circuit model of quantum computing which implies that quantum language models are richer than classical models unless BPP=BQP. It also implies that, under certain circumstances, quantum Boltzmann machines are more expressive than classical Boltzmann machines. Finally, we examine the performance of our approach numerically for the case of classical harmonic grammars and find that the method is capable of rapidly parsing even non-trivial grammars. This suggests that the work may have value as a quantum inspired algorithm beyond its initial motivation as a new quantum algorithm.},

  abstract = {We propose a new application of quantum computing to the field of natural language processing. Ongoing work in this field attempts to incorporate grammatical structure into algorithms that compute meaning. In (Coecke, Sadrzadeh and Clark, 2010), the authors introduce such a model (the CSC model) based on tensor product composition. While this algorithm has many advantages, its implementation is hampered by the large classical computational resources that it requires. In this work we show how computational shortcomings of the CSC approach could be resolved using quantum computation (possibly in addition to existing techniques for dimension reduction). We address the value of quantum RAM (Giovannetti,2008) for this model and extend an algorithm from Wiebe, Braun and Lloyd (2012) into a quantum algorithm to categorize sentences in CSC. Our new algorithm demonstrates a quadratic speedup over classical methods under certain conditions.},
